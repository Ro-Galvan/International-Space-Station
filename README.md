User Guide
=================

Users are encouraged to vist the website daily as the information is pulling real time data from APIs. 

1. Search

    - Search function that will take a user to Google if they are unfamiliar with any terminology or want to learn more about a topic. 

2. Picture of Day

    - Title and detailed description about the image pulled from NASA's API.

3. International Space Station (ISS)

    - When a user visits the page for the first time it will mark the current location of the ISS and save it to **local storage**. The next time the page is loaded it will connect the last location to the current location with a red line. This process is repeated until local storage is **cleared**. This allows a user to view and track the path of the ISS. The data is pulled from ISS's API. 
   
4. Nearest Objects

    - The Near-Earth-Objects are pulled from NASA's API for the current date and allows a user to see how many are orbiting close to Earth. The user can see the name, size, velocity, closest approaching time and if hazardous--color coded: green (not hazardous) , orange (potentially hazardous).
    
5. Other

    - In the footer a user can click on 3 icons: email contact and 2 APIs that were used.
